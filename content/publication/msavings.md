abstract: "The Chinese government plays a significant role in directing private
R&D and innovative activity. This top-down intervention has the potential to distort the optimal allocation of resources. Rogerson and Restuccia
(2008) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009) document that distortions in the allocation of capital and labor have large negative effects on productivity. I
extend the misallocation literature by developing a model with distortions
on R&D spending that alter the distribution of R&D across firm productivity. I use a Melitz model along the style of Atkeson-Burstein (2010) and
Hsieh and Klenow (2014) to identify both output and R&D distortions
and to estimate the effect of these distortions on aggregate productivity.
I calibrate the model using firm-level data from China’s Annual Survey
of Industries. I find that relative to a counterfactual economy with no
output distortions, adding China’s distribution of R&D distortions decreases aggregate productivity and GDP by about 12 percent. However,
China’s R&D distortions actually increase productivity by 5 percent in the
Chinese economy, because they partially cancel out the effect of output
distortions."
